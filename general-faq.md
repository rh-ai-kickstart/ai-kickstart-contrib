## What is a quickstart again? 

Quickstarts are simple, ready-to-use AI examples using Red Hat platforms. 
They are straightforward and focused example use cases - easy to launch, easy to
get, and *ready to go!*

## Where can I find quickstarts? 

AI quickstarts are collected here in the 
[AI quickstarts GitHub Organization](https://github.com/rh-ai-quickstart). 
Each 
[repository](https://github.com/orgs/rh-ai-quickstart/repositories)
 is a quickstart making it easy for you to get started.

## Are there requirements? 

Each quickstart comes with its own list of requirements. They're in the
quickstarts README. As long as you have the dependencies, you're good to go! 

We'll also use common tools to make things easier from time to time. Like: 
* `oc`
* `helm` 
* `make` 
* and many more

You don't *need* them, but you'll probably *want* them. 

## What if I don't have Red Hat AI yet? 

No problem! Quickstarts are educational materials even when they aren't
deployed! They include thorough descriptions, architectures and interactive
demos whenever possible. 

While we prioritize examples intended for Red Hat AI, OpenShift, and RHEL, we
often find ourselves contributing directly to open source projects. Some of
these contributions may find their way to our example catalog and can run in
other environments. 

## Will quickstarts run in my environment? Are these maintained? Are they products? 

Answers are *yes*, *yes* and *no*, respectively. 
- New quickstarts must be proven before they can be included.
- Your environment may differ from ours, but we'll clearly outline dependencies
  up front
- AI quickstarts are maintained by their owner
- Red Hat AI SMEs offer guidance as needed
- AI quickstarts are not Red Hat products. They are examples.
- quickstarts are not products and are not covered by Red Hat support 
- Best effort community assistance may be available
