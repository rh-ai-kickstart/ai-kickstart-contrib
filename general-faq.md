## Frequently asked questions :question: 

### What is a kickstart again? 

Kickstarts are simple, ready-to-use AI examples using Red Hat platforms. 
They are straightforward and focused example use cases - easy to launch, easy to
get, and *ready to go!*

### Are there requirements? 

Each kickstart comes with its own list of requirements. They're in the
kickstarts README. As long as you have the dependencies, you're good to go! 

We'll also use common tools to make things easier from time to time. Like: 
* `oc`
* `helm` 
* `make` 
* and many more

You don't *need* them, but you'll probably *want* them. 

### What if I don't have Red Hat AI yet? 

No problem! Kickstarts are educational materials even when they aren't
deployed! They include thorough descriptions, architectures and interactive
demos whenever possible. 

While we prioritize examples intended for Red Hat AI, OpenShift, and RHEL, we
often find ourselves contributing directly to open source projects. Some of
these contributions may find their way to our example catalog and can run in
other environments. 


### Will kickstarts run in my environment? Are these maintained? Are they products? 

Answers are *yes*, *yes* and *no*, respectively. 
- New kickstarts must be proven before they can be included.
- Your environment may differ from ours, but we'll clearly outline dependencies
  up front
- AI kickstarts are maintained by their owner
- Red Hat AI SMEs offer guidance as needed
- AI kickstarts are not Red Hat products. They are examples.
- kickstarts are not products and are not covered by Red Hat support 
- Best effort community assistance may be available 

### How do I ______? 

#### Get started 

Each repository is a standalone kickstart. Simply click through, read the
README, and follow the installation instructions.

#### Get help 

Have questions? Need help? We got you. Just open a GitHub issue in the relevant
kickstart repository!

Need help unrelated to a specific example? Open a GitHub issue in 
[ai-kickstart-contrib](https://github.com/rh-ai-kickstart/ai-kickstart-contrib/issues)

#### Contribute

##### Submit ideas or offer feedback

If you're using a kickstart and want to see changes, create a GitHub
issue with your request. We'll see if we can make it happen.

All feedback is welcome. Specific and actionable feedback is preferred. Please
create a GitHub issue directly in the kickstart repository.

For general feedback, please create an 
[issue in ai-kickstart-contrib](https://github.com/rh-ai-kickstart/ai-kickstart-contrib/issues)

##### Add a kickstart! 

Anyone can contribute a kickstart! :smile:
